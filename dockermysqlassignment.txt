first created an ec2 instance and login into it using putty by convering a pem file to ppk.
After that installed docker on ec2 instance
commands:
Sudo apt install docker.io
sudo docker version(able to see both client sand server)
docker version(it doesnt show server)
sudo usermod -aG docker ubuntu(Here group name is docker and user is ubuntu)
docker pull mysql(created an image of mysql by downloading)
docker run -d -p 3306:3306 -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=password mysql(created a process or container -d refers to detatched mode and -p refers to port mapping -e refers 
environment variables )
docker container ls(we can observe a container is created)
asked for docker credentials 
docker login (entrred user id and password)
docker exec -it f41b02d9504c bash(so that we can enter into container)
mysql -u root -p(login into my sql)
show databases;(It will list out databases present in it)
CREATE DATABASE  Employee;
use employee;
create table Info (EmpId INT, First_Name VARCHAR(20),Last_Name VARCHAR(20),Address VARCHAR(20),City VARCHAR(15), Department VARCHAR(10),Salary INT);
